## The project is being divided into the following stages: 
* Backend development which is in java language with Spring Boot framework;
* The frontend will be developed in JavaScript/TypeScript together with Framework React js.
* The application will be developed in React Native using Expo-cli, whose language is JavaScript, but TypeScript will be used because of the superset it incorporates into JavaScript, among them would be the static typing of variables.

### To run the backend you must have installed one of the following tools:

Spring Tools Suite or IntelliJ IDEA;\
